// Pre-bundle deps at startup so Vite doesn't re-run esbuild mid-session when
// the agent writes code that imports a new lib — the re-optimize bumps the
// deps hash and 404s chunks the iframe just loaded → white screen.
//
// `entries` tells Vite's scanner to also crawl @vibe/ui's source tree during
// startup, so every Radix/clsx/etc. import inside the workspace package gets
// discovered and pre-bundled before the iframe ever mounts.
//
// `include` only lists deps that live in apps/vite/node_modules (direct deps
// of apps/vite/package.json). Workspace sub-deps (clsx, radix-*, vaul, cmdk,
// react-hook-form, etc.) are reached via the @vibe/ui entries crawl above.
